This layer is active when you first see an app or maybe a website too. User would mostly be biased towards something which looks novel or unexpected than something which looks gross. Conversely you might be taken to an exhibition of luxury automobiles and before you&#x2019;ve arrived you&#x2019;ll be looking forward to the smell of fresh leather upholstery and the cool curves of the vehicles arrayed around you.</p><p>Visceral design aims to get inside the user&#x2019;s head and tug at their emotions either to improve the user experience (e.g., improving the general visual appeal) or to serve some business interest (e.g., emotionally blackmailing the user to make a purchase, to suit the business&#x2019;s objectives) (Komninos, 2017).</p><p>Lastly, this level has nothing to do with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is all about attraction or repulsion, and great designers use their aesthetic sensibilities to drive these visceral responses.</p><h1 id="layer-twobehavioral-%F0%9F%A4%8F">Layer Two - Behavioral &#x1F90F;</h1><p>[Story continues] <em><em>After getting into an apple store, there was no device I did not try to touch or feel. All of them felt wonderful and very personalised in my hand. Best part was when I started using iPhone 11, I played games, clicked photos of people from the store (which i deleted eventually :P ) ; mostly tried every new gesture apple has introduced and couldn&apos;t stop myself from buying an iPhone.</em></em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*EPPQMpwcARdsqOpF9dFa1A.png" class="kg-image" alt="3 layers of Emotional Design, every Product Designer Must Know" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Behavioural design is probably more often referred to as <em><em>usability</em></em>, but the two terms essentially refer to the practical and functional aspects of a product or anything usable we are capable of using in our environment. Behavioral design is interested in, for example, how users carry out their activities, how quickly and accurately they can achieve their aims and objectives, how many errors the users make when carrying out certain tasks, and how well the product accommodates both skilled and inexperienced users. Behavioral design is perhaps the easiest to <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/test" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">test</a>, as performance levels can be measured once the physical (e.g., handles, buttons, grips, levers, switches, and keys) or usable parts of an object are changed or manipulated in some way. For instance, buttons responsible for two separate operations might be positioned at varying distances from one another so as to test how <em><em>long</em></em> it takes the user to carry out the two tasks consecutively.</p><p>Alternatively, error rates might be measured using the same manipulation(s). Examples of experiences at the behavioural level include the <em><em>pleasure</em></em> derived from being able to find a contact and make a call immediately on a mobile phone, the <em><em>ease</em></em> of typing on a computer keyboard, the <em><em>difficulty</em></em> of typing on a small touchscreen device, such as an iPod Touch, and the <em><em>enjoyment</em></em> we feel when using a well-designed computer game controller (such as, in my humble opinion, the N64 control pad).</p><p>When products enable us to complete our goals with the minimum of difficulty and with little call for conscious effort, the emotions are likely to be positive ones. In contrast, when products restrict us, force us to translate or adjust our goals according to their limitations, or simply make us pay close attention when we are using them, we are more inclined to experience some negative emotion (Komninos, 2017).</p><p>Powerful and positive behavioural reactions allow users to feel a sense of empowerment, cultivate trust and reliability by creating a direct correlation between a user&#x2019;s actions and expected value, and also encourage repeat reactions, as people are more inclined to want to experience that delight again (Baker, 2019).</p><h1 id="layer-threereflective-%F0%9F%A7%A0">Layer Three - Reflective &#x1F9E0;</h1><p><em><em>Today I&#x2019;m sharing my &#x201C;Apple store&#x201D; experience with you all, since my entire experience was so amazing and fruitful. This is how people reflect to their experience in the form of stories and hence its called reflective layer</em></em> &#x1F609;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*wC46a8RaBFGtYfpsqx7Usw.png" class="kg-image" alt="3 layers of Emotional Design, every Product Designer Must Know" loading="lazy"></figure><p>This design layer is most powerful layer of all. positive reflective reactions may encourage users to share their experiences with others and evoke a sense of pride and identity from using a product that extends beyond the product itself. Overall, the reflective emotional design captures the meaning of the product, the impact of thoughts, the share-ability of the experience, and the cultural impact (Baker, 2019).</p><p>Unlike the other two levels, the reflexive level is linked to conscious cognition, where reasoning and conscious decision making takes place. Again, unlike unconscious thought, reflection at this level is deep and slow.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Holistic Design?

The Future of UX or a Buzzword?"><p><strong><strong>IDEAS IN BRIEF</strong></strong></p><ul><li>To apply holistic design principles is to consider different facets of a product, stakeholders&#x2019; interests and the environment within which it functions.</li><li>Best practices of holistic design consist of involving stakeholders, being sustainable, creating an ecosystem, and, last but not least, going beyond digital.</li><li>When it comes to holistic design in UX, it&#x2019;s essential to apply design thinking and reflect on the design system, make sure that solutions are inclusive and consistently invest in UX research.</li></ul><p>We are an agency full of seasoned <a href="https://www.eleken.co/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">UX designers</a>, but &#x201C;holistic design&#x201D; is not very easy to explain. Let&#x2019;s start with the main question:</p><h1 id="what-is-holistic-design">What is holistic design?</h1><p>Holistic design is a design approach that suggests looking at the product from different angles, considering all the aspects, stakeholders, and the environment.</p><p>However, the definition of holistic design is not enough to really understand the phenomenon. The holistic design combines the approach, practices, and philosophy.</p><p>Holistic design is not something that happens solely in the design department. It is synchrony of all the company processes: to provide a holistic user experience, a good-looking UI is not enough, you need a holistic mindset.</p><p>The term &#x201C;holistic design&#x201D; is often used in architecture, urbanism, and interior design. For example, ancient Greek tractates about urban planning suggested that architects should consider the directions of the winds when projecting the streets of the city in order to create the most comfortable air circulation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*XdsFDqmIJhPsKdAe.png" class="kg-image" alt="What Is Holistic Design? The Future of UX or a Buzzword?" loading="lazy"><figcaption><em class="akz" style="box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Factors influencing urban planning. Image credit: ramboll.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the problems related to holistic design in other spheres can help better understand how holistic design can be applied in the modern digital world.</p><p>When projecting an interior, designers should not only think of the clients&#x2019; tastes and general style consistency. Here are some of the questions designers have to consider while developing a holistic design:</p><ul><li>Is the neighborhood noisy? Does the apartment need noise isolation?</li><li>Are the materials sustainable? If we put this vintage fridge, would it be possible to fix it if it breaks in 5 years?</li><li>Is the furniture resistant enough to the cat&#x2019;s claws?</li></ul><p>Holistic design is not something that every client wants. It is a long process and requires not only the budget but also time and will to change the corporate processes and even culture. Of course, the company aiming for holistic design should have a high level of<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/user-experience-maturity-model" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> UX maturity</a>.</p><p>When the decision to adopt a holistic approach is well thought, you can start shifting to new design practices.</p><h1 id="rules-of-the-holistic-design-approach">Rules of the holistic design approach</h1><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*ACUFPdGtFsGejnH5.png" class="kg-image" alt="What Is Holistic Design? The Future of UX or a Buzzword?" loading="lazy"></figure><ol><li>Take into consideration <strong><strong>all the stakeholders</strong></strong>, not only users or customers. It doesn&#x2019;t mean that we have to solve everyone&#x2019;s problems with our product. Yet, we have to be aware of all things happening around us.</li><li><strong><strong>Research methods</strong></strong>.<strong><strong> </strong></strong>When we focus solely on users,<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/5-rules-of-ux-research-interview-questions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> individual interview</a>s are a golden standard of UX research. When we decide to take a holistic approach, we have to add other methods to our research, such as ethnographic research. We have to go out in the field to better understand the environment.</li><li><strong><strong>Participative practices</strong></strong>. A step forward from taking into account all of the stakeholders is to involve them in the design process. It is likely to be tricky and even messy, but giving such approach a try doesn&#x2019;t cost much. The promoter of<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/design-thinking-examples-five-real-stories" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> design thinking</a>, David Kelley, pointed out that involving people of different backgrounds significantly benefits the process.<strong><strong>Sustainability</strong></strong>. Most modern companies want to appear sustainable. They introduce the principle in various parts: from corporate responsibility programs to even the production process. There is always room for improvement in sustainability, and holistic design naturally raises the company standards.</li><li><strong><strong>Ecosystem</strong></strong>, not just design system.<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/7-design-systems-examples-for-your-inspiration" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> A design system</a> is a great tool for the company, but it applies mostly to the design sphere. It is often used to simplify and unify UI/UX design. Holistic design implies an ecosystem including values, philosophy, and attention to every detail.</li><li>Going <strong><strong>beyond digital</strong></strong>. Even if we are talking about a highly digitalized company, in the absolute majority of cases holistic design solutions will change physical items, such as offices, and also the human capital.</li></ol><h1 id="real-companies-holistic-or-not"><strong>Real companies. Holistic or not?</strong></h1><p>As we say that <em><em>holistic</em></em> is an idealistic term, it is hard to say that any company at all is <em><em>really</em></em> holistic. Yet, there is some that move in that direction. Sometimes these are the same companies that invest in the petroleum industry (nobody said &#x201C;holistic&#x201D; was simple).</p><p>Let&#x2019;s go through some examples to see how far famous companies can get on their way to becoming &#x201C;holistic&#x201D;. Is there a way to avoid mentioning Apple in an article about design? Not that we know.</p><h2 id="holistic-style-apple"><strong>Holistic style. Apple</strong></h2><p>Apple stands quite close to the holistic design approach. All the products have a clear consistent line, the company has a recognizable style and philosophy. All Apple products sync naturally and gather in an ecosystem: they look similar, they use the same software and user interface, they <em><em>feel the</em></em> same. Once people get used to the Apple ecosystem, they have hard times abandoning it.</p><p>However, the sustainability of Apple&#x2019;s design is questionable. The company is constantly using the principle of planned obsolescence and its products are not very easy to repair. Also, the well-known method of Apple is to create users&#x2019; needs rather than satisfy existing ones. Products are often designed with limitations that require users to adapt to them rather than adapting to users: for example, new iPhones have no power adapters.</p><h2 id="design-thinking-applied-bosch">Design thinking applied. Bosch</h2><p>The spectrum of the holistic design approach is large. It might be unexpectable to see this company as an example, but there is something we can learn from Bosch, a company with over 150 years history and quite a traditional line of products.</p><p>Apart from quality electro domestics, Bosch is known for its success in applying design thinking throughout a large established company. They started with launching a whole &#x201C;design thinking department&#x201D; and it changed the processes in the company leading to the redesign of office interiors to adapt to the reshaped collaboration models.</p><p>Bosch is now producing a wide range of products apart from washing machines. They construct smart buildings that promote sustainable living. This is a classic understanding of the holistic design approach in modern times.</p><p>One of the good practices that Bosch adopted is involving people of various profiles in the design process, such as engineers, testers, marketers, scientists. Diverse teams provide the best ground for innovative solutions.</p><p>How holistic is Bosch&#x2019;s approach? They mostly declare the design thinking approach, but being an old German company working with product design, they are well familiar with the notion of holistic design from the first sources. How sustainable is their product? Well, we&#x2019;ll leave it to the environmentalists.</p><h2 id="holistic-path-of-small-companies">Holistic path of small companies</h2><p>In this article, we&#x2019;ll leave apart the interior Feng Shui design companies and will focus on UX.</p><p>One of the companies that declare holistic design to be a cornerstone of their work is the Tactile design firm. They see UX as a cross-pollination of various disciplines, from architecture to marketing. No surprise that half of the company consists of industrial designers and engineers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*THVG44YNZfNUWRTy.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="What Is Holistic Design?

Also, they surely go beyond digital as they work a lot on physical interfaces and innovative technologies.</p><p>As a<a href="https://www.eleken.co/ui-ux-design" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> UI/UX design agency</a>, we are far from claiming ourselves holistically. However, we do like the approach and it is present in our work.</p><p>We always try to do a bit more than the client asks us. Solving the problem is good, but our objective is also to simplify the implementation of the design and think of<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/accessibility-in-ux-helpful-for-people-beneficial-for-business" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> design accessibility</a> even when it is not in the brief.</p><p>Take a look at the case study of<a href="https://www.eleken.co/cases/handprinter" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> Handprinter</a>, a lifestyle app. As the product itself is quite holistic, our approach was similar: we thought about all the stakeholders, thought not only about the principal user&#x2019;s goal &#x2014; decreasing the handprint &#x2014; but also about other aspects, such as a social network of like-minded people.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*lvV6f-CIVtYvUAFv.png" class="kg-image" alt="What Is Holistic Design?

Here are a few steps that will get you closer on the way to holistic design:</p><ul><li>Apply design thinking (you might think it is another buzz word and you&#x2019;ve heard of it a thousand times already&#x2026; But check out these<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/design-thinking-examples-five-real-stories" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> design thinking examples</a> from top companies if you have doubts).</li><li><a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/7-design-systems-examples-for-your-inspiration" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Design system</a>. It&#x2019;s likely that you already have one, but look at it closer: is it a real system based on philosophy or more of a visual components library? Are the principles of the design system used outside of design software?</li><li>Check if your design is<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/design-that-benefits-everyone-top-5-inclusive-design-examples" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> inclusive</a>. Without being inclusive, there is no thinking of a holistic user experience.</li><li>Provide consistent user experience.

We again have to code with <em><em>tags </em></em>JavaScript. Any web developer you would tell you that it is a pain to type the tags. In most cases, we need a tool that can quickly and easily generate tags and their children. <a href="https://emmet.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Emmet</a> is a really good example of this already built into VSCode. However, sometimes, you do just want something simple and concise. Such as an auto tag closer, which generates the closing pair of a tag as you type the opening pair. And when you change that same tag, the closing tag automatically gets changed. These two extensions do just that.</p><p><strong><strong>It also works with JSX and many other languages such as XML, PHP, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX.</strong></strong></p><p>Get them here &#x2014; <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Auto Close Tag</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Auto Rename Tag</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ME0oAmIJdO6zaaYwL1DPwA.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Top JavaScript VSCode Extensions for Faster Development &#x1F525;" loading="lazy"><figcaption><a class="au lv" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: inherit; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;">Auto Rename Tag</a></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*EbGIozYQA3qS3nXpNtSDeg.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Top JavaScript VSCode Extensions for Faster Development &#x1F525;" loading="lazy"><figcaption><a class="au lv" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: inherit; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;">Auto Close Tag</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="similar-extensions-%E2%80%94-2"><strong>Similar Extensions</strong> &#x2014;</h2><ul><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-complete-tag" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Auto Complete Tag</a> &#x2014; Combines the functionality of both Auto Rename and Auto Close Tag</li><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.compulim-vscode-closetag" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Close HTML/XML tag</a></li></ul><h1 id="gitlens">GitLens</h1><p>As told by its author, GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. <strong><strong>It packs a surprising number of features such as code authorship shown via Code lens, commit search, history and GitLens explorer.</strong></strong> You can read full explanations of these features <a href="https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">here</a>. <strong><strong>Suffice it to say that you should install this plugin if you do any work with git.</strong></strong></p><p>There are other extensions that focus on a specific functionality.
